Scholar Experience
=====
* Jun. 2023 - Sep. 2023: Cerebrovascular Network Atlas Construction, at SJTU, directed by Prof. Yao Li
  * Extracted vessels of SWI images using Frangi Filter.
  * Continuity processing of vessels using VED (Vessel Enhancement Diffusion).
  * Constructed a cerebrovascular network atlas from 5000 images (registered to the same template).
* Apr. 2024 - Oct. 2024: MRI Super-resolution based on diffusion models, at SJTU, directed by Assoc. Prof. Hongjiang Wei
  * Inspired by the idea from [Compressed Sensing with Deep Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01368)
  * Designed a degradation model to simulate low-field MRI images from high quality ones.
  * Innovatively added a deconvolution operator into the posterior sampling process.
  * Our architecture performed well on simulated low-field datasets, but poorly on real world low-field ones.
* Oct. 2024 - : Sodium and T2W MRI Fusion Representation of Arbitrary Resolution via Implicit Neural Representation, at SJTU, directed by Assoc. Prof. Hongjiang Wei
  * We proprosed an approach for reconstructing fused images from low-resolution T2W and Sodium MRI images.
  * The reconstructed images can be represented under arbitrary resolution.
  * Applying a self-supervised training strategy, the approach does not need high-resolution references during training.
  * The fused images can retain metablolic information from sodium images while exhibiting clearer anatomical structures.
  * The work is under the process of experimental validation. A manuscript has already been done.
